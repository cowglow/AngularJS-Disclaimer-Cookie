# DisclaimerBannerCookie

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cowglow/DisclaimerBannerCookie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cowglow/DisclaimerBannerCookie)

It has become common practice to include a disclaimer banner on your site. It usually displays on the user's first visit.
You still need to utilize a cookie to keep it from popping up again, when the user revisits the page.

The original project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1. But since then, Angular has evolved and Bower has been replaced by Yarn. So I modernized it.
